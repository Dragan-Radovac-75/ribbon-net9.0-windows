The Microsoft Ribbon Control .NET 9.0 for Windows. 

All components are contained in individual resource dictionaries (ribbon.xaml, ribbonbutton.xaml, ...). 

A sample of the ribboncontentpresenter is also included. Back stage can be modified by editing ribbonapplicationmenu.xaml. Size 'Popup' to what you desire. 

As of .NET Core, the RibbonWindow is no longer supported making the QuickAccessToolbar obselete.

All parts of the Ribbon are implemented using Framework only with no other dependencies ensuring seamless intergration into your project.
